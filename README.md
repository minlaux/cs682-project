# Generative Adversarial Networks for Galaxy Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Group Members
- Polina Petrova
- Aryan Singh

## Project Setup
### Data Download
We used the open-source Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset, downloaded from Kaggle, which contains classified galaxy images collected from the Sloan Sky Survey: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jaimetrickz/galaxy-zoo-2-images.

### Data Preprocessing and Model Training
Data and image preprocessing, as well as CNN model training, were conducted on a Google Colab notebook for greater processing power.
